# Poor practice 1

Web Service Instance should be in a private subnet, and the private subnet should be only accessible by the application load balancer with only http port 80 open.

# Poor practice 2

Web service instance should not have ssh enabled, we should use Aws System manager for machine access. Or use immutable ami technique, which there's no need to ssh.
In InstanceRolePolicy-C3, it allows access to all s3 buckets. We should only allow access to the normal receipe s3 bucket at the very least.
